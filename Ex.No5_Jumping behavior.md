# Ex.No: 5  Implementation of Jumping behavior 
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a python program to simulate Jumbing behavior. 
### Algorithm:
1. Start the program
2. Import the necessary modules
3. Initiate the pygame engine and window
4. Specify the necessary parameter for player height,depth,gravity,jump power. 
5. Create a game loop to simulate the continuous behavior.
6. If Quit button is pressed then quit the pygame window.
7. Move the player left when left button is pressed
8. Move the player right when right button is pressed
9. If space bar is pressed then enable the jump by increasing y axis value.
10. land the player and display the player at every timestep
11.  Stop the program
 ### Program:











### Output:



### Result:
Thus the simple jumping behavior  was implemented.
