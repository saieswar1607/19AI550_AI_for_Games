# Ex.No: 3  Implementation of Kinematic movement seek and flee behaviors 
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a python program to simulate the process of seek and flee behaviors using mouse movements.
### Algorithm:
1. Import the necessary modules pygame, math, random when necessary.
2. Initiate the pygame engine
3. Create a window with size (400,300)
4. Create a function to simulate the seek behavior - to move towards the target 
5. Create a function to simulate the flee behavior - to move away from the target 
6. Update the position of object
7. Create a game loop to display the update behavior
8. Call the seek function when left mouse button is pressed
9. Call the flee function when right mouse button is pressed
10. Close the pygame window when quit icon is clicked.
11. Stop the program
    
### Program:











### Output:



### Result:
Thus the simple seek and flee behavior was implemented successfully.
